# Trading Adviser Chatbot

This project is a Trading Adviser Chatbot designed to assist traders in making better decisions. The chatbot leverages AI to provide insightful trading advice and is integrated with WhatsApp via Twilio.

## Features

- Provides trading advice based on user queries.
- Utilizes ChatGPT-4 for generating responses.
- Integrated with WhatsApp using Twilio.
- Developed using Python and Flask.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

- `app.py`: The main application file that sets up the Flask API and handles communication with Twilio and ChatGPT-4.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- Twilio account and API credentials
- OpenAI API key for ChatGPT-4

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trading-adviser-chatbot.git
    cd trading-adviser-chatbot
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up environment variables for Twilio and OpenAI API keys:
    ```sh
    export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID='your_twilio_account_sid'
    export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN='your_twilio_auth_token'
    export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
    ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2. The API will be running on `http://localhost:5000`. You can use a tool like ngrok to expose the local server to the internet for testing with Twilio.

### Configuring Twilio

1. Log in to your Twilio account and set up a new WhatsApp sandbox.
2. Configure the webhook URL to point to your Flask API endpoint (e.g., `http://your-ngrok-url/webhook`).

## Usage

1. Send a message to your Twilio WhatsApp number.
2. The message will be received by the Flask API, which forwards the query to ChatGPT-4.
3. The response from ChatGPT-4 is then sent back to the user via WhatsApp.
